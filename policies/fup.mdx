### Overview
This Fair Use Policy is designed to prevent fraud and abuse of our services. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate services that are in violation of this policy. This policy is subject to change at any time.

### Resource Usage
All plans, no matter the type (VPS, GameServers, WebHosting, etc), is subject to a fair use policy regarding the shared resources that are available. We try our best to make this as relaxed as possible, but there are resources that are shared with other users that you must keep in mind when using your product.

We deem abuse to be usage that can cause a significant or noticeable impact on other machines, or usage that is excessive for your plan. Generally, we find that you should maintain under a 75% average CPU usage on game servers in order to prevent any potential impact on other users. If we do find that your usage is excessive, we may deprioritize your CPU usage or potentially, in some rare circumstances, implement a 50% (or lower) temporary CPU usage limit. Most of our host nodes usually have plenty of CPU resources available, and hence it is rare that we have to implement caps or limitations, these are just general guidelines. It is fine to temporarily burst past 75% CPU usage, but sustained usage past that can be deemed as excessive and may be temporarily deprioritized and/or capped if a host node is running out of CPU compute resources.
