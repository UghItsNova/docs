There are two ways to add operators to your Minecraft server:

### Method 1: Adding Operators via the Control Panel
1. Select the `Players` tab
2. Under Player Management > Operators select the Plus sign
3. Enter the username of the player you want to add as an operator
4. Click `Op Player`

### Method 2: Adding Operators via the Console
1. Click `Console` on the left-hand side of the server's control panel
2. Type `op <username>` and press `Enter`


Your Minecraft server should now have operators. Operators have access to commands that can help you manage your server.
