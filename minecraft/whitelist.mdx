There are two ways to Manage Whitelist on your Minecraft server:

### Method 1: Manage Whitelist via the Control Panel
1. Select the `Players` tab
2. Under Player Management > Whitelisted select the Plus sign
3. Enter the username of the player you want to whitelist
4. Click `Whitelist Player`

### Method 2: Manage Whitelist via the Console
1. Click `Console` on the left-hand side of the server's control panel
2. Type `whitelist add <username>` and press `Enter`


Your Minecraft server should now be whitelisted. Players will now need to be added to the whitelist to join your server.
