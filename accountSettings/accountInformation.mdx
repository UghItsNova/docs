Login to the [SanoServers Control Panel](https://panel.sanoservers.com/)<br/>
Navigate to ``Account Settings`` by pressing the 3 dots next to your name on the bottom left of your screen.<br/>
Here, you will see 3 sections, ``Personal Information``, ``Update Password`` and ``Two-Step Verification``.
### Personal Information

#### First/Last Name

Your first and last names are used to identify you within our internal systems. These do not have to be your actual first and last names, if you are not comfortable with sharing that information. <br/>
To change your first and last name, simply click on the text fields titled ``First Name`` and ``Last Name`` and enter your first/last name.<br/>
Now click on the text field titled ``Password`` and enter your current account password, then simply hit ``Update Details``.<br/>

#### Username

Your Username is used for accessing the SFTP/FTP of your server. This can be anything you like. <br/>
To change your username, simply click on the text field titled ``Username`` and enter your desired username.<br/>
Now click on the text field titled ``Password`` and enter your current account password, then simply hit ``Update Details``.<br/>

#### Email

Your email is used for keeping track of who owns which server, meaning your servers are linked to your email. <br/>
It is currently not possible to change your email through the panel. To change your account email, please open a ticket in the [SanoServers Discord Server](https://www.discord.gg/sanoservers/). <br/>
### Update Password

To update your password, simply click on the text field titled ``Current Password``, enter your current account password and move on to the next step. <br/>
Next, click on the text field titled ``New Password`` and enter your desired new password. <br/>
Now click on the text field titled ``Confirm New Password`` and re-enter the same password as you did in the last step. <br/>
Now just hit ``Update Details`` and your password is now changed.
